  The Household Economic Model predicts consumption expenditure per person
  per day. Model training for South Sudan depends on the World Bank's High
  Frequency Surveys, which were conducted in four waves over 2015-2017 and
  aggregated to clusters of roughly 10-30 households around a jittered
  centroid. Model training for Ethiopia depends on LSMS surveys by the
  Central Statistical Survey (CSA) of Ethiopia conducted in three waves over
  2011-2016. Consumption expenditure is reported in USD spent by one adult
  equivalent (normalized by average caloric demand by age and gender) per day.
  The input files are a combination of outputs from other models within this
  project (Population Model, Accessibility Model) and publicly available
  datasets (night time light, landcover classification). The model output
  is available as TIFF formatted raster files and JSON.
