  The malnutrition model predicts the malnutrition rates for Global Acute Malnutrition (GAM) and Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM).
  According to World Health Organization (WHO) guideline, GAM and SAM are defined as weight-for-height z-score below -2, and weight-for-height z-score below -3, respectively. By this definition, GAM includes all categories of malnutrition.
  The input variables taken into consideration are:
    - CHIRPS
    - Consumer Price Index(CPI)
    - population
    - cereal production per capita
    - consumption expenditure
    - Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)
    - month

        The geoTIFF files are created by HiResRasterMasked Task to return number of malnutrition cases for each monthly timepoint for baseline values and rainfall scenario values. The output is 1km^2 masked hi-resolution raster.
        -9999 is assigned to the pixel where the prediction is not availale or if the pixel falls outside of the geographical mask
