description: |-
  The soil moisture model predict surface soil moisture and then threshold soil moisture
  to determine impassable areas.
  The input variables taken into consideration are:
    - Land forms
    - Topographic wetness index
    - Soil texture
    - Rainfall

input_files:
  - name: CHIRPS daily rainfall data
    description: |-
      The rainfall data is for Africa and has a spatial resolution of about 0.05 degree.
    metadata:
      unit: mm/day

  - name: Land forms
    description: |-
      The ALOS Landform dataset provides landform classes created by combining the
      Continuous Heat-Insolation Load Index (CHILI) and the multi-scale
      Topographic Position Index (mTPI) datasets. It is based on the
      USGS's 10m NED DEM (available in EE as USGS/NED).
    Metadata:
      unit: The dataset has 15 classes
