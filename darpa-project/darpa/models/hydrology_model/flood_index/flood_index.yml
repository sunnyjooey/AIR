  The flood index is daily flash flood indicator which uses dynamic and distributed
  runoff co‐efficient which depends on the initial soil moisture. This co‐efficient,
  namely the European Runoff Index based on Climatology (ERIC), is used to
  weigh each contribution of the upstream precipitation proportionally to the
  initial soil moisture.
  The input variables taken into consideration are:
    - Rainfall flux
    - Surface runoff
    - Subsurface runoff
    - Digital Elevation Model
    - River basin
