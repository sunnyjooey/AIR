# Hydrology model

Currently hydrology model is composed of European Runoff Index Based on Climatology (ERIC) and Soil Moisture. The two sub-model can be used to identify flooded pixel. The next step is to combine the two model to identify flood pixels. 

The documentation of ERIC can be found [here](https://gitlab.kimetrica.com/DARPA/darpa/blob/master/models/hydrology_model/flood_index/README.md) and that of soil moisture can be found [here](https://gitlab.kimetrica.com/DARPA/darpa/blob/superset-output-flood-index/models/hydrology_model/soil_moisture/README.md)
