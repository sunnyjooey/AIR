# River Discharge Model
According to [Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters (CRED)](https://www.cred.be/) 
floods were the most frequent natural disasters occurring worldwide from 2000 to 2019. 
The frequency of floods occurrence is also increasing, rising from 71 events per year on average between 1980 and 1999 to an annual average of 171 events in the period between 2000-2019.

Our aim is to develop a riverine flood forecasting model that scales to different regions with no manual calibration.

The model uses a data driven approach to forecast river discharge.
River discharge is the amount of water that flows through a river section at a given time. 
We combine our predicted river discharge values with flood threshold (the capacity of a river to cause flooding) to calculate the total extent of flooding. 
A single Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) is trained using past values of discharge, meteorological time series data and static attributes.
[Kratzert et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.08456) shows a single universal deep learning model can learn both regionally-consistent and 
location-specific hydrologic behaviors. [Kratzert et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.08456) benchmarked the LSTM model with classical hydrology models.

## Data
The Copernicus Climate Data Store (CDS) API is used to scrape the following datasets:
* GloFAS Daily river discharge ($`m^3 s^{-1}`$).
* ERA5-Land hourly 2 meter temperature data (kelvin).
* Upstream area in ($`m^2`$).

To use the Copernicus Climate Data Store (CDS) API, user id and key are required to be added to the `.env` file. 
Therefore first create an CDS account [here](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/user/register/) and 
visit [this page](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/user/) to get the user id and the key.

The Climate Hazards group Infrared Precipitation with Stations (CHIRPS) is the source of the daily rainfall data.  
It is scrapped from https://data.chc.ucsb.edu/products/CHIRPS-2.0/africa_daily/tifs/p05/.

The source of the digital elevation model (DEM) is HydroSHEDS.

## Data preprocessing
The script [data_pre](https://gitlab.com/kimetrica/darpa/darpa/-/blob/master/models/hydrology_model/river_discharge/data_pre.py) 
scrapes, resample and compile data from various sources into an [xarray](http://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/) dataset that is used to train the model.
Data preprocessing steps include:
* Scraping river discharge from [Copernicus Climate Data Store](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/cems-glofas-historical?tab=overview)
* Scraping upstream area from [Copernicus Climate Data Store](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/cems-glofas-historical?tab=overview)
* Scraping temperature data from [Copernicus Climate Data Store](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/reanalysis-era5-land?tab=overview)
* Scraping rainfall data from [Climate Hazards group Infrared Precipitation with Stations (CHIRPS)](https://data.chc.ucsb.edu/products/CHIRPS-2.0/africa_daily/tifs/p05/)
* Hourly 2 meter temperature data is aggregated to get daily data.
* Rainfall and digital elevation data is resampled to match the spatial resolution of the river discharge.
* Before training the model the data is normalized to a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.

The data used for inference is pre-processed and saved in CKAN as a netcdf file. The temporal coverage of pre-processed data is from Jan 2017 to Dec 2018 for both South Sudan and Ethiopia.

## Building the model
<div align='center'><fig><img src="lstm.png"  width="95%" height="75%"><figcaption>Fig.3: The Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTM) model architecture </figcaption></div>
<br>
The Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTM) model is trained with the meteorological time series data and static location specific attributes. 
The length of input sequence is 60.

LSTM is a type of neural network arichitecture that is optimized for time series prediction that requires long memory. 
The key to LSTMs is the cell state and various gates.
Cell state carries relevant information throughout the processing of the sequence. 
The information gets added or removed to the cell state via gates.
During training the gates learn which information is relevant to keep or forget.

```math
    f_{t} = \sigma(W_{f}.[h_{t-1}, x_{t}] + b_{f})
```
```math
    i_{t} = \sigma(W_{i}.[h_{t-1}, x_{t}] + b_{i})
```
```math
    g_{t} = tanh(W_{g}.[h_{t-1}, x_{t}] + b_{g}
```
```math
    C_{t} = f_{t} * C_{t-1} + i_{t} * g_{t}
```
```math
    o_{t} = \sigma(W_{o}.[h_{t-1}, x_{t}] + b_{o}
```
```math
    h_{t} = o_{t} * tanh(C_{t})
```

where: $`f_{t}`$ is the forget gate, $`i_{t}`$ is the input gate,
$`g_{t}`$ is the cell input, $`C_{t}`$ is the cell state, $`C_{t-1}`$ is the previous cell state,
$`o_{t}`$ is the output gate, $`h_{t}`$ is the hidden state, $`h_{t-1}`$ is the previous hidden state, and  $`x_{t}`$ is the input.

## Model output

## Constraints
The LSTM model for predicting river discharge is run in sequence-to-value mode. The discharge values in the sequence are the observed values and not the predicted values.
