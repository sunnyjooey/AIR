  The River Discharge Model predicts river discharge in m3 per second. The model
  also extimate flood extent matching predicted river discharge with return periods.
  The return periods are calculated by fitting river discharge annual maxima 
  from 1981 to 2016 in gumbel distribution.
  The input data is mostly from European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) 
  and is accessed using CDS api.To use the API one need to add USER ID (UID) and key to the `.env`. 
  To get the UID and key first create and account [here](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/user/register/) 
  and visit [here](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/user/) to get the UID and the key. The model output
  is available as TIFF formatted raster files and JSON.
